# Please Read!

Trace has not been updated in a while due to personal circumstances.

Once I am able to begin development again, I will be re-coding Trace using the new Manifest version 3 API.

Updates will be posted on my telegram channel linked below.

Thank you for your patience.

## Issues
You can report issues here or via email.

Please include the browser name and version you are using Trace on as well as the version of Trace.

## Install From Source Code
### Chromium/Chrome/New Edge

- Download and extract the `MyTrace` folder ([link](https://github.com/jake-cryptic/AbsoluteDoubleTrace/archive/master.zip)).
- Move the MyTrace folder to a location of your choosing, e.g. Documents folder
    - When you go to update Trace in the future, replace this MyTrace folder with the new one.
    - If you move this folder your extension settings will be reset, so make sure to create a backup before doing so.
- In the browser, navigate to chrome://extensions
- Enable **Developer mode** if it is not already enabled. You should see some new options appear.
- Click **Load unpacked extension...**.
- When prompted, locate the `MyTrace` folder and press **Open**
- The extension should now be installed.

This method will warn you each time you open the browser that "Developer extensions" are installed.
If this gets annoying then you could create a shortcut to your Chromium executable with the commandline flag:
`--load-extension='PATH_TO_EXTENSION'` where PATH_TO_EXTENSION is the full file path to the MyTrace folder.
